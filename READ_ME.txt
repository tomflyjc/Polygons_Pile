 
This QGIS 2.x experimental Extension Polygons_Pile was made in order to easily view some layer of polygons objects. 
The purpose is to see the smallest polygons on top of the largest.
Althougth such a viewing can be acheived with the style properties in latest QGIS version in can be helpfull to sent a lyaer of "pyramid like ordered pile" of polygons to users.  
NOTA BENE: all rasters should be unchecked in layer panel or the plugin won't work !
Warning: above a bunch of hundred objects, depending on your computer power, the plugins may be slow, very slow... due to the poor sorting method of the polygons areas.
